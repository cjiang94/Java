==== Welcome ====

This is my repository including my Java code when I was studying at the University in Oslo - Norway.

Please feel free to browse through my code and make suggestions as you like!

NOTE:	This is code from my first and second year and my way of coding has changed a bit over the years.
	Also the language I've used is mostly Norwegian.
