1. How to compile your program (ie. javac *.java)
    - You compile by writing "javac Oblig2.java <filename>.txt"

2. Which ﬁle includes the main-method
    - File Oblig2 includes the main-method

3. Any assumptions you have made when implementing the assignment
    - In the example of "Latest start, slack and critical tasks" it was explained that task 1 has 3 slack. After drawing up the graph, this did not make sense.
      So in my assumption task 1, in the example, should have slack 2. This is because tasks that are critical have 0 in slack. So if we move 1 time unit, that should be 1 slack. While task 1 can only slack 2 time units.

4. Any peculiarities about your implementation
    - You wanted us to run with the command "java Oblig2 <projectName>.txt manpower. I have not implemented my assignment with taking manpower in as a parameter in args. I thought this might be for 
      the optional assignment where manpower had a more important role. 

5. The status of your delivery (what works and what does not)
    - Everything should be working fine (after what I saw in the output). But I can admit that there's some places that can be optimized for running time and efficiency.

6. Give credit if your code is heavily inﬂuenced by some source (ie. teaching material)
